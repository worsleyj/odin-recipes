        <p>Imagine a luxuriously textured bourbon-spiked custard being sipped through a thin layer of nutmeg-scented meringue. 
            Based on Alton Brown's famous version, this eggnog is <i>vastly</i> superior to the store-bought product.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients for Chef John's Homemade Eggnog</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Custard Base</h4>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 fluid ounces bourbon whiskey, or more to taste</li>
            <h4>Meringue</h4>
            <li>4 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>Be sure to use the freshest ingredients (eggs, milk, and cream) and freshly grate the nutmeg.</h4>
            <li>Place egg yolks in a saucepan. Whisk in sugar until well blended and creamy. Add milk and cream; 
                whisk until blended. Place pan over medium heat; whisk frequently until mixture reaches a temperature of 
                between 170 to 180 degrees F (75 to 80 degrees C) using an instant-read thermometer. 
                Remove from heat. Stir in nutmeg and whiskey.</li>
            <li>Chill pan in cold water until cool. Transfer mixture to a container (a large pitcher is ideal). 
                Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Place egg whites in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Add sugar and continue whisking until egg whites hold 
                a firmer peak. Whisk egg whites into custard base until thoroughly blended. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggnog again just before serving and between each pour to ensure even distribution of the egg whites which tend to float to the top. Serve with a dusting of nutmeg.</li>
        </ol>
