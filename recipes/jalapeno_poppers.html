        <h1>Jalapeno Poppers</h1>
        <img src="../images/jalapeno_poppers.webp" alt="picture of jalapeno poppers">
        <p>This is a recipe for stuffed jalapenos I had at a baby shower in Texas. I loved them and have made them for every party since. They are always anxiously requested, a HIT AT EVERY PARTY!!!! Use toothpicks to secure the bacon around the stuffed jalapenos. Be sure to use a pan that won't let the bacon drip all over the oven while cooking!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients for Jalapeno Poppers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) packages ground sausage</li>

            <li>30 jalapeno chile peppers</li>
            <li>1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Drain sausage and place in a medium bowl. Mix with the cream cheese.</li>
